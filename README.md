# pyPhotoMaterials

I sell my photos on a Japanese media platform called "[note](https://note.com/tnnamm/m/m2aa9550047ed)". The Python script is made in v3.8.6 and is intended to simplify the process of making and publishing the photo materials.

It has the following features.

* Create ZIP files based on jpg files output from Lightroom Classic.
* Uploading the ZIP and JPG files to the server(using FTP_TLS).
* Writing URLs (including shortened URLs) to a text file to be written in the introductory article of note.

All features assist my publishing workflow.

I made it in the course of learning Python. I think it was a good experience :)
