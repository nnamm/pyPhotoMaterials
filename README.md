# pyPhotoMaterials

I sell my photos on a JPN media platform called "[note](https://note.com/tnnamm/m/m2aa9550047ed)". The Python script simplifies my creating and publishing of the photo materials.

It has the following features.

* Create ZIP files based on jpg files output from Lightroom Classic.
* Uploading the ZIP and JPG files to the server(using FTP_TLS).
* Writing URLs (including shortened URLs) to a text file in the introductory note article.

All features assist my publishing workflow. I made it in the course of learning Python :)
